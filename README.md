This repository demonstrates a less common Python bug: the UnboundLocalError.  The bug arises from improper exception handling within a function where a local variable's value is conditionally set within a try-except block. If an exception occurs and the variable is not initialized, accessing it afterward raises the UnboundLocalError. The solution showcases how to correctly handle this by ensuring the variable is always assigned a value before being used. This is a subtle issue but critical to preventing unexpected crashes.
